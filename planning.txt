on recursion request (missing_strength - production)
return (value, loss) tuple combinations
filtering at the very end
hand list of visited tiles up the call stack
unmark as visited when recursion is left

don't build combinations of border tiles
have a nice heuristic
select the border with best heuristic
apply it and filter the paths for the other borders
filter the borders with no paths
repeat from 9 until none are left
